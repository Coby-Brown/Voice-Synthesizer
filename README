#Setup Instructions
Begin by setting up python virtual envirnoment by running the setup script in the VSCode (Or other IDE) terminal (THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MEANT FOR USE OUTSIDE OF AN IDE):
bash setup.sh


# Quickstart Instructions
1. Start Virtual Environment:
source venv311/bin/activate

2. Run the main script with the desired text and output file:
python main.py <text|text_file> <output_file> [config_file]

3. Output file will be generated as the specified filename (e.g., output.wav)


# Training Instructions
To train the model with your own voice samples, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your voice samples:
Convert samples to a .wav format if they are not already

2. Place Samples in Training folder

3. Run the command:
python main.py "Hello World!" output.wav training.yaml

4. The model will generate a new voice cache file. Re-run the command to check if the training is to your liking.

5. If satisfied, move the file to your desired voice folder.

6. Create a new .yaml file for that voice.


# Command
python main.py <text|text_file> <output_file> [config_file]

- <text|text_file>: Text to synthesize or a file containing text
- <output_file>: Path to save synthesized audio
- [config_file]: Optional YAML config file (default: config.yaml)


# Example config.yaml:
preset: fast # preset: Synthesis preset (ultra_fast, fast, standard, high_quality)
randomness: 0.5 # randomness: Controls voice randomness(Tempurature) (float, e.g., 0.5) - Lower values will produce more consistent results, higher values will produce more varied results
sample_cache: "basic.pt" # sample_cache: Name of cache file for voice samples (string)
reference_folder: "voices/Default" # reference_folder: Folder containing reference .wav files or reference cache file (string)


## Example commands
python main.py "Hello World!" output.wav Default.yaml
python main.py "Hello World!" output.wav
python main.py "[Default] Hello World!" output.wav
